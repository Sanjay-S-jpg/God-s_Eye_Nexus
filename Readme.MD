This project proposes an AI-powered crowd safety monitoring system that runs on a regular laptop and mobile/USB camera, making it lightweight and cost-effective for demonstration and small-scale deployment. The system integrates computer vision and deep learning to:

Detect and count people in real time to assess crowd density.

Identify sudden abnormal movements indicating possible stampede.

Flag harassment-like close-contact behavior using proximity rules.

Track and alert when a child or smaller individual separates from the group.

Detect weapons such as guns or knives using pretrained object detection models.

The solution provides a simple live dashboard displaying the video feed with alerts and can be easily extended to CCTV networks or drone cameras in the future. This makes it suitable for a scalable real-world safety systems.
